Hey everyone, I am pretty new to coding and I've just created my first little game!
It's a Higher or Lower type game about company market capitalization.
I thought I'd be a fun way to learn about the actual wealth of a company and what they actually do.
I am aware, that the site does not look professional at all, but I'm hoping to improve that over the next few days or weeks :)
Thanks for reading and have fun!
